The Showcase window displays a large (400 px x 400 px) preview image which is usually the first specified PictureURL, as well as up to 11 (64 px x 64 px) selectable thumbnails for the remaining EPS images. Clicking on the preview image displays the item's listing page.

If Plus is selected and the request includes only one EPS image or any self-hosted images, the listing includes a Gallery Plus icon that, when hovered over or clicked, displays a large (400 px x 400 px) preview image of the item. Clicking the image displays the View Item page for that listing.

When using RelistItem or ReviseItem (item has no bids and more than 12 hours before the listing's end), Plus can be unselected in the request. However, the Plus fee will still apply if a previous request selected Plus. There is at most one Plus fee per listing.

When 'Plus' is included in an item listing, the listing also automatically gets the Gallery functionality at no extra cost. 'Gallery' does not need to be specified separately in the listing.

Listing images that are originally smaller than 400 px x 400 px are centered in the preview frame. Images that are originally larger than 400 px x 400 px are scaled down to 400 px on their longest side (maintaining their original aspect ratio).
